# Colour Sort Puzzle

## Introduction

The Color Sort Puzzle is a game of skill and speed. The user is presented with a grid of 24 colour tiles. On the grid, there are 6 different colours with 4 tiles of each colour. There is a space on the grid to allow users to move the coloured tiles around the grid. There is also a mini grid of nine tiles displayed on screen and the aim of the game is for the user to match the inner 9 tiles on the main grid with the 9 colour tiles on the mini grid.

Once the user clicks a button the tiles on both grids will be shuffled. Once this stops, a timer will start and the game begins. The user can move the tiles on the main grid by clicking on the tile. The only moveable tiles will be the ones beside the empty space.

Once the colour tiles are matched the timer will stop. The user is asked to enter their name and their name and time will be displayed on a leader board table displayed on the next screen. The user is given an option to play again.
